# KanjiCards

Kanjicards is an app for memorizing Kanji words. Try it [HERE!](http://gigihsigap.github.io/kanjicards)

## About

Made using React, TypeScript, and vanilla CSS.\
I need to prepare for a Japanese language course so why not.

Heavily inspired from Pseudomon's [Lightning Cards](https://pseudomon.github.io/lightningcards/#).

## Features

- Test your kanji knowledge using the Practice Mode!
- Create your own set of cards, or use premade decks!
- Works completely offline if you save the page!

## Download

This app is completely front-end, so you can save the page and it'll work offline. It automatically saves your decks locally in your browser, but you can also use the import/exporter feature to create a backup or to move to a different system/browser.


## Contribute?

You can help by creating a set of cards. For example:\
- A deck of various places in kanji...
- A deck of common Japanese names...
- Or any deck with a theme!

I want to keep the project running entirely on front-end.\
Premade cards in .JSON format will be placed on `premades` directory.
