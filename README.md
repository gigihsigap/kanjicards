# KanjiCards

Kanjicards is an app for memorizing Kanji words. Try it [HERE!](http://gigihsigap.github.io/kanjicards)

## About

Made using React TypeScript and vanilla CSS.\
I need to prepare for a Japanese language course so why not.

Heavily inspired from Pseudomon's [Lightning Cards](https://pseudomon.github.io/lightningcards/#).


## Offline Use

You can download the .zip by clicking the green "Code" download button on top right.\
Alternatively, just clone this repository using Git.

To install, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.\
Then you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred browser.


## Contribute?

You can help by creating a set of cards. For example:\
- A deck of various places in kanji...
- A deck of common Japanese names...
- Or any deck with a theme!

I want to keep the project running entirely on front-end.\
Premade cards in `.JSON` format will be placed on `premades` directory.
